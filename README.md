# Fn4Us Games

This was a fun project that I made over a weekend that could play games in a browser. This is also my biggest and _most complex website_ yet suprisingly. 
All of these games I did not make nor do I claim that. This is all legal (I hope) as these games are opensource. 

**MINECRAFT, ZELDA, AND SM64 ARE ALL REMAKES**

This website was pretty easy to make even though that I couldn't find 1 tutorial on how to embed your own local game into a website. I only found ones about embeding one from another website. Here is how I did mine:

1. Make a basic website with a nice interface. You could skip this step but it is not recommended.
2. Download some game from github (safe) or somewhere else by using [DownGit](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home) or something else.
3. Put the game into the same files that you are running your game on. This depends on what you are using so I can't really help you there.
4. Embed the game into your website. You can do this by putting code like this in your .html file: ```<embed type="text/html" src="game.html">``` or something similar.
5. Now you have a game in your website. (This probably wasn't very clear and I am sorry for that.)
