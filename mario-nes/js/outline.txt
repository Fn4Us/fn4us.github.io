    redraws the foreground

LevelLoader:
  Reads in a BIG ASS ARRAY of all the different types of things
  and puts together the whole dang level.

Object:
  position, velocity, acceleration
  hitbox dimensions
  reference to the game
    
    
Enemy:
  movableObject
  
  #collideWith
    checks collision. Bounces off of walls and other enemies. Kills marios.
    gets killed by block bonk from below
    
  Specific enemy behaviors:
    koopas get replaced with shells 
    shells get kicked if touched from the side, instead of killing
  
Mario:
  #collideWith
    gets expelled from walls, bonks blocks, destroys blocks as big Mario
    note: collision with blocks is determined by which one is over the center
      if you're slightly to the side, you slip past it.
  Crazy-ass sprite shifting if you're in star mode!
    
    
Item
  #collideWith
    item pickup logic 
    
Mushroom
  type
  
  #update
    movement logic for mushrooms
    get impulse from being block bonked
      this can be implemented by giving them the appropriate accel
      just if they overlap a block from the bottom.
      of course, only AFTER they finish sliding out of the block.

  holds the image for a sprite sheet
   #update
    method to set the sprite for the next frame
  
  #render
    method to actually place the new image on the canvas
    
Water levels:
  make a separate class for water Marios
    less gravity
    swimming sprite
    fireballs are the same
    jump works when not on the ground
  different enemies
    
What about the demo?
  Honestly no idea
